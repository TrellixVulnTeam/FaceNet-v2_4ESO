# FaceNet

This is a Keras implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper [FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832).

## Dependencies
- [NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Dataset

VGGFACE2 is a large-scale face dataset with 9,000+ identities and 3.3 million+ face images.

## Usage
### Data Pre-processing
Extract training images:
```bash
$ python pre-process.py
```

### Train
```bash
$ python train.py
```

If you want to visualize during training, run in your terminal:
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir path_to_current_dir/logs
```

### Demo

Download [pre-trained model](https://github.com/foamliu/Look-Into-Person/releases/download/v1.0/model.119-2.2473.hdf5) and put it into models folder.

```bash
$ python demo.py
```

### Evaluation

Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database info:

- 13233 images
- 5749 people
- 1680 people with two or more images

Download the [LFW database](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz) and put it under data folder:

```bash
$ wget http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz
$ tar -xvf lfw-funneled.tgz
$ wget http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/pairs.txt
$ wget http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/people.txt

$ python lfw_eval.py
```

Accuracy is: 89.27 %.
